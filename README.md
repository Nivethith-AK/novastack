## Customization Guide

If you want to rebrand NovaStack AI, start here:

- `app/layout.tsx` - metadata, fonts, and app shell
- `app/page.tsx` - homepage section order
- `app/globals.css` - design tokens and color system
- `components/landing/navigation.tsx` - navigation and brand identity
- `components/landing/hero-section.tsx` - hero copy and primary CTA
- `components/landing/features-section.tsx` - product value cards
- `components/landing/how-it-works-section.tsx` - workflow explanation
- `components/landing/infrastructure-section.tsx` - infrastructure messaging
- `components/landing/metrics-section.tsx` - proof points and numbers

## Content Notes

- The site is currently branded as NovaStack AI.
- The screenshot in `public/readme-homepage.png` was captured from a production build on localhost.
- The layout is already sectioned for easy copy, visual, and branding updates.
- Most future changes should stay inside the landing section components rather than the page shell.

## Suggested Improvements

If you want to take the README even further, add any of the following:

- A deployment section for Vercel or another host
- Brand color tokens with hex values
- A short edit guide for content owners
- A live demo link once the site is deployed
