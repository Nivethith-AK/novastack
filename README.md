## Overview

NIVI Energy Drink is a marketing site built with the Next.js App Router. It includes an animated hero, product carousel, feature cards, community/feed sections, and a social call-to-action footer. The layout is already opinionated and production-shaped, so the main things you will usually change are the brand name, colors, images, and copy.

## Features

- Animated hero section with a floating hero product shot
- Product carousel for flavor or variant storytelling
- Bento-style feature grid with motion and hover states
- Community and Instagram-style visual feed sections
- Smooth scrolling and subtle interaction effects
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Clean component structure for quick branding updates

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run on a different port:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

npm run start
```

Run linting:

```

## Project Structure

- `app/` - App Router pages, root layout, and global styles
- `components/` - Landing page sections and reusable UI pieces
- `hooks/` - Shared React hooks
- `lib/` - Utility helpers
- `public/` - Static assets such as product and lifestyle images
- `styles/` - Global stylesheet source

## Customization Guide

If you want to rebrand the site, start here:

- `app/layout.tsx` - page title, metadata, and theme color
- `app/globals.css` - global design tokens and color system
- `components/hero-section.tsx` - hero copy and product image
- `components/flavor-carousel.tsx` - variant cards and carousel content
- `components/lifestyle-section.tsx` - social-style image grid and captions
- `components/social-section.tsx` - Instagram-style gallery and CTA
- `public/` - replace product photos and lifestyle images

## Content Notes

- The site is currently branded as NIVI Energy Drink.
- Local development was verified on port `3001`.
- The gallery assets in `public/` are already wired into the feed sections.
- You can replace the product image set without changing the component structure.

## Suggested Improvements

If you want to take the README even further, add any of the following:

- A short deployment section for Vercel or GitHub Pages
- Brand color tokens with hex values
- A section showing where to edit text and images
- A live demo link once deployed
